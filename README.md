# ctodo
A minimalist CLI to-do list program written in C. Sensible arguments. No frills. No fuss. Only C.

About the license, because I am not *all* that familiar with making C programs that are memory safe, the software needs to be provided "AS-IS". Plus, I'm just making this for my uses. If anyone want's to add features, I'm down, but this to-do program "market" seems pretty saturated. If you see this, I'm surprised you got here!
